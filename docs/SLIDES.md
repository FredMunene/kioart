## PITCH SCRIPT FOR SLIDE 1 (2 minutes)

**Opening** (warm, confident):
> "Good morning Godfrey and Akinyi! Thank you so much for taking the time to meet with us today. I'm Allan Robinson, and this is my co-founder Fred Gitonga. We're both software engineers right here in Kisumu, and we've been working closely with the Baraza community for some time now."

**The Big Reveal** (clear and direct):
> "Today we want to share with you an exciting project we're calling **JamiiSanaa** - which means 'Art Community' in Swahili. It's Kenya's first digital marketplace built specifically for local artists to sell their artwork online."

**Why This Name** (make it personal):
> "We chose JamiiSanaa because it perfectly captures what we're building - not just another website, but a true community. Jamii means community, Sanaa means art. This is about bringing artists and art lovers together in one trusted space."

**What Makes It Special** (build excitement):
> "JamiiSanaa will let artists do three powerful things: First, sell physical artwork like paintings and photographs online with just a few taps on their phone. Second, create digital NFTs of their art - opening up global markets. And third, receive commissions and build real, sustainable income."

**The Partnership Angle** (connect to them):
> "But here's what makes this truly special - we don't want to build this alone. We want to build it IN PARTNERSHIP with Baraza Media Lab. Why? Because Baraza already has the artists, the trust, the community, the gallery space - everything needed to make this succeed. Together, we can create something transformative for Kenya's creative economy."

**The Team** (build credibility):
> "Behind this vision, we have a strong team. Fred and I are the co-founders bringing technical expertise. We also have a development team of 6 skilled developers ready to build this platform. But we need Baraza's partnership to bring the community, the artists, and the credibility that makes this work."

**Transition** (set up next slide):
> "So let me start by explaining the problem we're solving - because I know you both see it every day here at Baraza..."

## SLIDE CONTENT:

**The Problems Artists Face Today**:

1. **No Consistent Marketplace**
   - Artists create beautiful work but have nowhere to sell it regularly
   - Baraza's gallery stores art, but it doesn't move fast enough
   - Social media posts get lost in the noise
   - No centralized, trusted platform exists

2. **Can't Reach Buyers**
   - Local buyers don't know where to find quality Kenyan art
   - International buyers can't discover or access Kenyan artists
   - Diaspora Kenyans want to buy local art but have no easy way
   - Corporate buyers need art but don't know where to source it

3. **Irregular Income**
   - Artists only sell during special events or festivals
   - Income is unpredictable and unsustainable
   - Can't plan or grow their art business
   - Many talented artists give up and pursue other careers

4. **Manual, Inefficient Processes**
   - Artists must physically bring art to galleries
   - Pricing is often guesswork
   - Payment collection is manual and slow
   - No data on what sells or what buyers want

**The Cost of Doing Nothing**:
- 200+ talented Baraza artists not reaching their potential
- Thousands of shillings worth of art sitting unsold
- Artists leaving the creative economy for other work
- Kenya's rich artistic heritage undervalued globally

## PITCH SCRIPT FOR SLIDE 2 (2 minutes)

**Make It Personal** (start with empathy):
> "So let me paint a picture you both probably see every day. You know that room at Baraza where we store all the paintings, photographs, and artwork from our members? Beautiful pieces, right? Work from incredibly talented people."

**The Painful Reality** (build the problem):
> "But here's the heartbreaking truth - most of it just sits there. Week after week, month after month. Not because it's not good. Not because there aren't buyers who would love it. But simply because there's no good way to connect the artist with the buyer."

**Real Examples** (make it concrete):
> "Think about Jane who paints those stunning Lake Victoria sunsets. Or Peter who captures Kisumu street life through photography. Or Mary who does those beautiful Luo cultural pieces. They're incredibly talented. But right now, if they want to sell, what are their options?"

**List the Limited Options** (show the gap):
> "Maybe they post on Facebook or Instagram and hope someone sees it among thousands of other posts. Maybe they try to sell at the market and compete with mass-produced prints. Or maybe they wait for Baraza to organize an event - which you both know takes enormous effort and doesn't happen often enough."

**The Bigger Picture** (show scale):
> "It's not just a Baraza problem. It's a Kenya problem. We have thousands of talented artists across this country who can't make a living from their art. Not because they lack talent, but because they lack access to markets."

**The Opportunity Cost** (what we're losing):
> "And here's what breaks my heart - I've seen artists give up. Really talented people who could be earning 50,000, 100,000 shillings a month from their art. But instead, they're doing something else because they can't survive on irregular art sales."

**The International Angle** (expand the vision):
> "Meanwhile, there are buyers right now - in Nairobi, in the diaspora, in New York, in London - who would LOVE to buy authentic Kenyan art. They're looking for it. They're willing to pay good money for it. But they can't find our artists."

**The Core Problem** (summarize clearly):
> "So the problem is simple: we have supply - talented artists creating amazing work. We have demand - buyers who want authentic Kenyan art. But we don't have the connection between them. We don't have a reliable, trusted marketplace."

**Transition** (set up the solution):
> "That's exactly what JamiiSanaa is designed to solve..."

## PITCH SCRIPT FOR SLIDE 3 (3 minutes)

**Introduce the Solution** (clear and simple):
> "So here's our solution: JamiiSanaa. Think of it like Jumia or Amazon, but specifically and only for Kenyan art. A digital marketplace that's open 24/7, accessible from any phone, connecting artists directly with buyers."

**Make It Relatable** (use analogy):
> "Let me explain how simple we're making this. For artists, it works just like posting on Facebook or Instagram, but when someone likes your art, they can actually BUY it right there and then. No DMs, no negotiating in WhatsApp, no meeting at random cafes to exchange cash. It's all handled through the platform."

**Walk Through Artist Journey** (step by step):
> "Here's exactly what an artist does:"

> "Step 1: Jane finishes her Lake Victoria painting. She takes a good photo with her phone."

> "Step 2: She goes to JamiiSanaa.com or our app, clicks 'Upload Art', and fills in simple information - title, description, price. Takes maybe 5 minutes total."

> "Step 3: The artwork comes to Baraza for approval - that's where you, Godfrey and Akinyi, or someone you assign, looks at it and approves it. This quality control is important. It ensures only real, quality art makes it onto the platform."

> "Step 4: Once approved, boom! The artwork is live. Now anyone browsing JamiiSanaa can see it. Someone in Nairobi. Someone in Mombasa. A Kenyan living in London. A tourist who visited Kisumu."

> "Step 5: When someone buys it - let's say for 15,000 shillings - Jane gets notified immediately on her phone. The buyer pays via M-Pesa. We take a small commission - about 10 to 15 percent. And Jane receives 12,750 to 13,500 shillings directly to her M-Pesa within 24 hours."

**Walk Through Buyer Journey** (equally simple):
> "For buyers, it's even easier:"

> "Sarah in Nairobi is decorating her new apartment. She goes to JamiiSanaa.com on her phone or laptop. She browses beautiful Kenyan art, filters by price or style. She finds Jane's Lake Victoria painting - 'Perfect for my living room!'"

> "She clicks 'Buy Now', enters her M-Pesa number, gets the STK push on her phone, approves the payment. Done. The painting gets packaged and delivered to her door, or she can pick it up here at Baraza if she's local."

**The Magic Ingredient** (emphasize partnership):
> "But here's what makes JamiiSanaa special - it's not just another website. Every Baraza artist gets a 'Baraza Verified' badge. Buyers know they're getting real, quality art. They trust the Baraza name. That's powerful."

**Multiple Revenue Streams** (show versatility):
> "Artists can sell in different ways too. Fixed prices for most pieces. But for special artwork, they can run auctions - imagine a countdown timer, people bidding, excitement building. We've also built a commission system where buyers can request custom artwork and artists can accept or negotiate."

**The NFT Angle** (keep it simple):
> "Now, I mentioned NFTs earlier. I know that sounds technical, so let me explain simply. An NFT is basically a digital certificate that proves who owns the art. Some buyers - especially younger ones and international collectors - really want this. It's trendy globally."

> "But here's the key - it's completely optional. Artists who don't understand NFTs or don't want them can simply sell the traditional way. For artists who do want it, we make it FREE to create. The buyer pays a tiny fee (less than a shilling) when they purchase. This opens up a whole new market without any cost to artists."

**The Bottom Line** (summarize benefits):
> "So to sum up - JamiiSanaa lets artists sell 24/7, reach buyers everywhere, get paid quickly and fairly, and build real, sustainable businesses from their art. All from their phone. All with Baraza's trusted backing."

**Transition** (move to features):
> "Now let me show you the key features that make this work..."

## PITCH SCRIPT FOR SLIDE 4 (3 minutes)

**Set Up the Importance** (frame it):
> "Now let me walk you through the top features that make JamiiSanaa work - and more importantly, show you exactly what problems each one solves. Because we didn't just build features for fun. Every single one addresses a real pain point artists face today."

**FEATURE 1: The Marketplace** (emphasize consistency):
> "Feature number one - the core marketplace. Artists get their own professional profile page. They can upload as much artwork as they want - 5 pieces, 50 pieces, 500 pieces. All searchable, all organized, all available 24/7."

> "The problem this solves? Right now, an artist is limited to whenever and wherever they can physically display their work. Maybe a Baraza event once every few months. Maybe carrying pieces around hoping someone buys. With JamiiSanaa, their entire catalog is online, always available, always working for them - even while they sleep."

> "Imagine Jane has 20 paintings. Instead of storing them at home gathering dust, they're all online, being seen by hundreds of people every week. Even if only one sells per month, that's consistent income."

**FEATURE 2: M-Pesa Integration** (make it Kenyan):
> "Feature two - and this is CRITICAL for Kenya - full M-Pesa integration. Buyers can pay directly with M-Pesa using STK push. No credit card needed. No complicated online forms. Just their phone number, approve on their phone, done."

> "Why does this matter? Because 80% of Kenyans use M-Pesa but don't have credit cards. If we force credit card payments, we lose most of our potential buyers. But with M-Pesa, we meet Kenyans where they are."

> "And for artists? Payment comes straight to their M-Pesa within 24 to 48 hours. No waiting weeks for checks to clear. No cash to carry around. Automatic, fast, secure."

**FEATURE 3: Baraza Verified** (connect to their brand):
> "Feature three - the 'Baraza Verified' badge. This is where the partnership really shines. When someone browses JamiiSanaa and sees that Baraza verified badge on an artist's profile, they immediately trust it."

> "Why? Because Baraza has spent years building a reputation. When Baraza says 'this is quality art from a real artist,' people believe it. That badge is worth its weight in gold for increasing sales."

> "Plus, Baraza members get benefits - lower fees, only 10% instead of 15%. Priority placement in search results. Access to special Baraza events and marketing campaigns."

**FEATURE 4: Global Reach** (expand the vision):
> "Feature four - global market access. Right now, a Kisumu artist is limited to people who physically come to Kisumu or attend a Baraza event. Maybe a few thousand potential buyers total."

> "With JamiiSanaa, that same artist can reach Kenyans in the diaspora - there are over 3 million Kenyans living abroad who would love to buy art from home. They can reach international collectors in New York, London, Dubai who are actively looking for African art. They can reach tourists who visited Kenya and want a memory."

> "The market goes from thousands to millions. Same art, same artist, but 100× more potential buyers. That's the power of digital."

**FEATURE 5: Commission System** (show the premium opportunity):
> "Feature five - the custom commission system. This is where artists can really earn. Someone wants a family portrait? A company wants custom art for their office? A buyer has a specific vision?"

> "They submit a commission request through the platform. Artists can accept, negotiate the price and timeline, or decline. Once they agree, the buyer pays a deposit - let's say 50% - which we hold in escrow. This protects both parties."

> "The artist does the work, submits it, buyer approves, and the remaining payment is automatically released. No chasing clients for payment. No risk of getting scammed. Everything is secure."

> "Commission work typically pays 2 to 3 times more than regular sales. One 50,000-shilling commission can be worth five 10,000-shilling paintings. This feature alone could transform an artist's income."

**Summarize the Impact** (bring it together):
> "So those are the five core features. But notice the pattern? Every single one solves a real problem:"
> - "No place to sell → 24/7 marketplace"
> - "Payment hassles → M-Pesa integration"
> - "Trust issues → Baraza verified badge"
> - "Limited market → Global access"
> - "Can't find clients → Commission system"

**Transition** (set up the ask):
> "Now, building something this powerful doesn't happen for free. Let me show you what we need from Baraza to make this a reality..."

## PITCH SCRIPT FOR SLIDE 5 (4 minutes)

**Be Direct and Transparent** (earn trust):
> "Alright, let's talk about what we need from Baraza. I want to be completely transparent with you both because this has to be a real partnership built on honesty and trust."

**THE BIG ASK: Money** (don't hide it):
> "First and most importantly - we need financial support. Specifically, we're requesting 2 million shillings from Baraza's 2026 budget. I know that's a significant amount. So let me explain exactly why we need it and what Baraza gets in return."

**Break Down the Budget** (show it's thought through):
> "That 2 million pays for three main things:"

> "First, platform development - paying our team of 6 developers to build the website, mobile app, payment integration, all the features I showed you. That's 1.5 million."

> "Second, infrastructure - servers to host the platform, domain name, security, tools our developers need. That's 400,000."

> "Third, people and operations - maintaining the platform after launch, customer support, legal fees to set everything up properly, and marketing to get buyers onto the platform. That's 1.1 million."

**Show It's Not ALL Baraza** (share the burden):
> "Now, Baraza isn't funding this alone. That 2 million is 62% of the total budget. We're covering the other 38%:"

> "Fred and I are contributing 500,000 in 'sweat equity' - that's the value of our time and expertise. We're also applying to 16 different grant programs targeting another 500,000. And we're projecting some early revenue from sales once we launch, about 200,000."

> "So Baraza puts in 2 million, but the total value going into this project is 3.2 million."

**What Baraza Gets** (make it worth it):
> "So what does Baraza get for that 2 million investment?"

> "First - 60% ownership of the platform. Baraza becomes the majority owner. That means 60% of all profits, forever. Let me put that in perspective:"

> "Our conservative projections show that by Year 2, the platform generates about 6.75 million in profit. Baraza's 60% share of that is 4 million shillings. In one year."

> "By Year 3, we project 26.75 million in profit. Baraza's 60% share is 16 million shillings. Every year after that."

> "So Baraza invests 2 million once, and gets back 4 million in Year 2, 16 million in Year 3, and growing after that. That's an 8× return in just 3 years. Show me another investment that good." *pause for effect*

**THE SECOND ASK: Community Access** (this is easier):
> "Second thing we need - access to Baraza's artist community. You both know these artists personally. We need your help introducing us, explaining what this is, why it's good for them, and helping us onboard the first 20 to 30 artists."

> "We're not asking you to do the technical training - we'll handle that. But we need you to open doors, make introductions, lend credibility. When you, Godfrey, or you, Akinyi, tell an artist 'This is legit, you should try it,' they'll listen. They trust you."

**THE THIRD ASK: Physical Space** (show the revenue opportunity):
> "Third - we'd like to use Baraza's gallery space for art storage and as a pickup point. Here's why this benefits Baraza:"

> "Artists can choose to store their artwork here instead of at home. We charge a small storage fee - about 3% of the artwork's value. That fee goes entirely to Baraza as additional revenue."

> "Local buyers can come view art in person before buying - which builds trust and increases sales. And Baraza becomes the hub where art changes hands. That foot traffic can benefit other Baraza programs too."

**THE FOURTH ASK: Brand Trust** (the intangible asset):
> "Fourth - and this might be the most valuable - we need Baraza's brand. The 'Baraza Verified' badge on artist profiles will be critical for building buyer trust."

> "Baraza has spent years building a reputation as a trusted organization in Kenya's creative community. When buyers see that Baraza endorses an artist or artwork, they feel confident purchasing. That's worth more than any marketing campaign we could run."

**What We Bring** (make it balanced):
> "Now, what do Fred and I bring to the table? We bring all the technical expertise - we build the entire platform, handle all the tech, manage the servers, deal with bugs, add new features. We bring blockchain and NFT knowledge that's rare in Kenya. We handle all customer support, operations, daily management."

> "We also commit to writing grant applications to bring in additional funding. We'll manage the business side - analytics, growth strategy, partnerships."

**The Ownership Split** (explain the logic):
> "So the partnership structure we're proposing: Baraza gets 60% ownership, we get 40%."

> "Why 60/40? Because Baraza is contributing more than just money. You're providing the artists, the space, the brand, the community trust - things we couldn't build ourselves. That's worth majority ownership."

> "But we also need meaningful ownership - 40% - because that keeps us motivated and committed. If we were just contractors getting paid a salary, we might leave after a year. But as 40% owners, our success is directly tied to the platform's success. We'll pour our hearts into this."

**Address the Elephant** (acknowledge the commitment):
> "I know 2 million is a lot to ask. I know budgets are tight and there are competing priorities. But let me ask you this: what other investment can Baraza make that:"
> - "Directly empowers 200+ artists"
> - "Generates millions in sustainable revenue"
> - "Positions Baraza as a tech innovation leader"
> - "Creates measurable impact you can show donors"
> - "Returns 8× the investment in 3 years"

> "I don't think there are many opportunities like this."

**Transition** (set up challenges):
> "Now, I want to be honest about the challenges too. Because every business has risks..."

**Challenges We'll Face & How We'll Address Them**:

---

### **CHALLENGE 1: Business Partnership Structure Clarity**

**The Question**:
How does Baraza Media Lab (a registered NGO) partner with a for-profit technology venture? What's the legal structure? How does revenue sharing work while maintaining Baraza's NGO status and donor compliance?

**Why It's a Challenge**:
- NGOs have restrictions on commercial activities
- Donors may question for-profit partnerships
- Tax implications need careful structuring
- Governance and decision-making clarity required

**Our Solution**:
1. **Legal Structure Options** (choose best fit):
   - **Option A**: Create separate for-profit subsidiary company ("Baraza Ventures Ltd")
     - Baraza NGO owns 60% of subsidiary
     - Allows commercial activity without affecting NGO status
     - Clear separation of operations

   - **Option B**: Licensing agreement
     - Tech team owns platform
     - Baraza licenses brand, space, community access
     - Revenue sharing based on licensing fees

   - **Option C**: Social enterprise model
     - Hybrid structure balancing profit and mission
     - Reinvest profits into Baraza programs

2. **Professional Guidance**:
   - Hire NGO law specialist (Budget: KES 100,000)
   - Recommended firms: Bowmans, Oraro & Company, ADRA Advocates
   - Draft shareholder agreement with clear terms
   - Ensure donor compliance and tax optimization

3. **Transparent Governance**:
   - Joint board: 2 Baraza reps + 2 Tech reps
   - Major decisions require 75% approval
   - Clear roles: Baraza handles artists/brand, Tech handles platform
   - Quarterly financial reporting

---

### **CHALLENGE 2: Service Costs (Storage, Photography, Operations)**

**The Question**:
Who pays for storage when art is kept at Baraza? Who covers photography costs for quality listings? How do we handle platform operational costs like customer service, shipping coordination, etc.?

**Why It's a Challenge**:
- Can add up to significant ongoing costs
- May deter artists if fees too high
- Needs clear policies to avoid confusion
- Must remain affordable to support artists

**Our Solution**:

**Storage Costs**:
- **Artist Choice**: Storage at Baraza is OPTIONAL, not mandatory
- **Fee Structure**: If artist chooses Baraza storage → 3% of artwork value per month
- **Revenue**: 100% of storage fees go to Baraza (covers space, security)
- **Alternative**: Artists can store at home and ship when sold

**Photography Costs**:
- **Artist Responsibility**: Artists take their own photos (phone is fine)
- **Support Provided**: We create photo guides and best practices
- **Free Workshop**: "How to Photograph Your Art" training session
- **Optional Service**: Professional photography available (artist pays, or Baraza offers as service)

**Platform Operational Costs**:
- **Covered in Budget**: Customer service, tech support, servers - all in Year 1 funding
- **Year 2+**: Covered by platform revenue (commissions on sales)

**Shipping Costs**:
- **Buyer Pays**: Shipping charged to buyer, not artist
- **Pickup Option**: Free local pickup at Baraza avoids shipping entirely

---

### **CHALLENGE 3: Business Model - Grant vs. SaaS vs. Revenue Share**

**The Question**:
How do we fund this long-term? Is it a one-time grant project? Software-as-a-Service model? Cost-per-sale revenue share? What happens after Year 1 funding runs out?

**Why It's a Challenge**:
- Different models have different incentives
- Need sustainability beyond initial funding
- Must balance affordability for artists with platform viability

**Our Solution: Hybrid Multi-Year Model**

**Year 1 (Launch Year)**:
- **Model**: Initial investment/grant
- **Funding**: KES 3.2M (Baraza KES 2M + grants + in-kind)
- **Focus**: Build platform, onboard artists, prove concept
- **Revenue**: Some sales commissions but not yet self-sustaining

**Year 2+ (Growth & Sustainability)**:
- **Model**: Self-sustaining SaaS (Software-as-a-Service)
- **Revenue Sources**:
  1. **Transaction Commissions** (primary): 10-15% of all sales
  2. **Storage Fees**: 3% of stored artwork value (to Baraza)
  3. **Premium Features** (future): Featured listings, advanced analytics
  4. **Auction Premiums**: Higher commission (15-20%) on auction sales
  5. **Commission Services**: 15% fee on custom art projects

**Revenue Split**:
- Baraza: 60% of platform profits
- Tech Team: 40% of platform profits

**Break-Even Target**: Month 18-24
- After this point, platform self-funds from revenue
- No additional funding needed
- Profits distributed quarterly

**Long-Term Vision**:
- Platform becomes asset generating ongoing income
- Reinvestment into features, marketing, expansion
- Potential to expand beyond Kenya

---

### **CHALLENGE 4: Baraza's NGO Status vs. Commercial Activity**

**The Question**:
Can Baraza, as an NGO, engage in commercial/for-profit activities? Will this affect donor funding, tax-exempt status, or mission alignment? How do we navigate NGO regulations while building a revenue-generating platform?

**Why It's a Challenge**:
- Kenya NGO regulations may restrict commercial activities
- Donors may view for-profit ventures as mission drift
- Tax authorities may question tax-exempt status
- Need to maintain transparency and compliance

**Our Solution**:

1. **Legal Structuring** (most important):
   - **Separate Legal Entity**: Create "JamiiSanaa Ltd" or "Baraza Ventures Ltd"
   - Baraza NGO owns 60% equity but entity is registered as for-profit company
   - Clear separation maintains NGO compliance
   - Precedent: Many NGOs worldwide own for-profit subsidiaries (e.g., BRAC, Ashoka)

2. **Mission Alignment Defense**:
   - Document how platform advances Baraza's mission:
     ✅ Empowers artists (core mission)
     ✅ Creates sustainable income for creatives
     ✅ Measurable social impact (# artists helped, income generated)
     ✅ Revenue funds further Baraza programs
   - Frame as "earned income" strategy (common NGO practice)

3. **Donor Communication**:
   - Transparent reporting to donors about partnership
   - Emphasize impact metrics, not just profit
   - Show how platform amplifies Baraza's mission
   - Separate accounting: NGO activities vs. commercial activities

4. **Tax Optimization**:
   - Consult tax attorney to structure correctly
   - Ensure NGO status unaffected
   - Proper taxation of for-profit entity
   - Dividend/profit distribution taxed appropriately

5. **Governance Safeguards**:
   - Independent board oversight
   - Conflict of interest policies
   - Regular audits and transparency reports
   - Community advisory board (artists have voice)

---

**Additional Challenges & Solutions**:

**Challenge**: Artist Adoption (what if artists don't use it?)
- **Solution**: Start with 20-30 early adopters, show success stories, provide hands-on training, make it stupidly simple

**Challenge**: Buyer Demand (what if buyers don't come?)
- **Solution**: Aggressive marketing to diaspora, corporate buyers, tourists; partner with interior designers; host events; SEO optimization

**Challenge**: Technology Failures (bugs, downtime, security breaches)
- **Solution**: Experienced dev team, thorough testing, security best practices, 24/7 monitoring, backup systems

**Challenge**: Competition (what if Jumia or others enter the space?)
- **Solution**: First-mover advantage, deep community ties via Baraza, artist-first focus, local expertise

---

## PITCH SCRIPT FOR SLIDE 6 (4 minutes)

**Set the Tone** (honesty builds trust):
> "Alright, now let me be completely honest with you about the challenges. Every business faces obstacles, and I'd rather address them upfront than pretend they don't exist. Plus, we've thought through solutions for each one."

**CHALLENGE 1: Partnership Structure** (acknowledge complexity):
> "First big question - and this is one we need legal help with - how does Baraza, as an NGO, partner with a for-profit technology venture? Can you even do that?"

**Explain the Concern** (show you understand):
> "NGOs have restrictions on commercial activities. Donors might question it. Tax authorities might have concerns. So we need to structure this properly."

**Present Solutions** (show it's solvable):
> "The good news is, this is totally doable. We have three main options:"

> "Option one - create a separate for-profit company. Let's call it 'Baraza Ventures Limited' or 'JamiiSanaa Limited.' Baraza NGO owns 60% of this company, but it's legally separate. Lots of NGOs worldwide do this - organizations like BRAC, Ashoka, even some here in Kenya."

> "Option two - licensing agreement. We build the platform, Baraza licenses the brand and community access to us, and we pay revenue share back to Baraza."

> "Option three - social enterprise model, which is kind of a hybrid between non-profit and for-profit."

**The Key Action** (be clear):
> "Bottom line - we need to hire a lawyer who specializes in NGO law. I'm recommending we budget 100,000 shillings for this. They'll help us pick the best structure, draft the agreements, make sure everything is legally sound."

**CHALLENGE 2: Service Costs** (address fears):
> "Second challenge - costs. Who pays for what? Storage, photography, shipping - these can add up. Artists might worry about hidden fees."

**Address Each Cost** (be specific):
> "So let's be crystal clear:"

> "Storage - completely optional. If an artist wants to store their art at Baraza, they pay a small fee - 3% of the artwork's value per month. That fee goes to Baraza to cover the space and security. But artists can also keep art at home and only bring it when it sells. Their choice."

> "Photography - artists take their own photos with their phones. We'll teach them how to take good photos. It's easier than you think. Most modern phones take great pictures. If someone wants professional photography, they can pay for it separately, but it's not required."

> "Shipping - buyers pay for shipping, not artists. Or buyers can choose free pickup at Baraza."

> "Platform costs - servers, maintenance, customer service - all covered in the Year 1 budget we're requesting."

**CHALLENGE 3: Long-term Funding** (show sustainability):
> "Third challenge - sustainability. What happens after Year 1? Do you have to keep funding this forever?"

**Explain the Model** (timeline it):
> "Great question. Here's the plan:"

> "Year 1 is the investment year. That's the 2 million from Baraza plus other sources. We're building the platform, onboarding artists, proving the concept. We'll make some revenue from sales commissions, but not enough to cover all costs yet."

> "Year 2 and beyond - the platform becomes self-sustaining. Revenue comes from commissions on every sale - 10 to 15%. Storage fees go to Baraza. Auction sales have higher commissions. Custom commissions generate fees. All that revenue covers operational costs and generates profit."

> "Our projections show we break even around Month 18 to 24. After that, no more funding needed. The platform pays for itself and generates profit for both Baraza and the tech team."

> "So Baraza invests once, not ongoing. After Year 2, it's pure profit."

**CHALLENGE 4: NGO Commercial Activity** (the elephant):
> "Fourth challenge - some donors or board members might ask: 'Should an NGO be in the for-profit business? Isn't that mission drift?'"

**Reframe It** (change the narrative):
> "Here's how I'd answer that: This isn't mission drift. This is mission EVOLUTION. Baraza's mission is to empower creatives, right? For years, you've done that through workshops, training, events. All valuable."

> "But now, you have a chance to create SUSTAINABLE empowerment. Instead of a one-time workshop, you're creating a platform that helps artists earn income month after month, year after year. That's not drift. That's scaling impact."

> "Plus, many respected NGOs worldwide have for-profit arms. It's called 'earned income strategy.' You use business revenue to fund your mission instead of always depending on donor funding. It makes Baraza MORE sustainable, not less mission-focused."

**The Legal Path** (reassure):
> "And legally, as I mentioned, we'll structure it properly. Separate entity, proper accounting, transparent reporting. It's all doable with the right legal advice."

**Address Hidden Concerns** (anticipate objections):
> "Now, I know some people might think: 'What if artists don't actually use this? What if we build it and they don't come?'"

> "Fair concern. Here's why I'm confident: We're not trying to get random artists. We're starting with Baraza's existing members who already trust you. We only need 20 to 30 artists to start. Once they start making sales and sharing their success, others will follow. Word of mouth is powerful."

> "Someone else might ask: 'What if buyers don't come? What if you build the marketplace but there's no demand?'"

> "Also fair. That's why we have a aggressive marketing plan. We're targeting Kenyan diaspora - 3 million people who want to stay connected to home. Corporate buyers who need art for offices. Interior designers who source for clients. Tourists who visited Kenya. International collectors interested in African art. The demand is there, we just need to reach them."

**Close with Realism** (earn trust):
> "Look, I'm not going to stand here and say this will be easy. Building a successful platform takes work. There will be challenges we haven't even thought of yet. Technology will have bugs. Some artists won't adopt it. Some buyers will be difficult."

> "But Fred and I are committed. We have the skills. We have a plan. And with Baraza's partnership, we have the community trust and credibility to make this work."

**Transition** (move to roadmap):
> "So let me show you the roadmap - how we actually build this thing..."

## PITCH SCRIPT FOR SLIDE 7 (4 minutes)

**Set Expectations** (show it's planned):
> "Alright, let me show you exactly how we're going to build this. We've broken it down into 5 phases over 12 months. I'll walk you through each one so you know exactly what's happening and when."

**PHASE 1: Planning** (emphasize foundation):
> "Months 1 and 2 are all about planning and legal setup. This is where we hire that NGO lawyer I mentioned, decide on the business structure, sign partnership agreements, register the company."

> "We're also finalizing all the technical specifications - exactly what features we're building, how the database works, what the design looks like. We're setting up the development team, getting everyone aligned."

> "Think of this as laying the foundation. If we rush this part, everything else will be shaky. Budget for these 2 months: 350,000 shillings."

**PHASE 2: Development** (the heavy lifting):
> "Months 3 through 6 - this is where the real work happens. Our team of 6 developers is building the actual platform. Writing code every day."

> "What are they building? Everything. The artist portal where artists upload art. The marketplace where buyers browse. The shopping cart and checkout. M-Pesa integration - probably the most complex part. The admin dashboard for Baraza. Payment systems. NFT infrastructure."

> "We're also doing security audits to make sure everything is safe and can't be hacked. This is the most expensive phase - 1.8 million shillings - because it's the most labor-intensive."

**PHASE 3: Soft Launch** (de-risk it):
> "Months 7 and 8 - this is our soft launch or beta testing phase. Here's why this is smart: we don't just throw open the doors to the whole world immediately. We start small and controlled."

> "We invite 30 to 50 Baraza artists - people you trust. We help them upload their artwork, train them how to use the platform. Then we invite a small group of buyers - maybe Baraza community members, maybe friends and family - to test buying."

> "Real transactions happen. Real money changes hands. But on a small scale. This lets us find bugs, get feedback, improve things before the big public launch."

> "We're also creating marketing materials during this time - taking professional photos of some artwork, writing press releases, planning the launch event. Budget: 400,000."

**PHASE 4: Public Launch** (make it exciting):
> "Month 9 - the big moment. Public launch! This is where we make noise."

> "We host a launch event right here at Baraza Kisumu. Big celebration. Invite media, journalists, bloggers, artists, buyers, partners. We do live demonstrations of the platform. Maybe even a live auction where people can bid on artwork in real-time."

> "We send press releases to Kenyan media. We run social media ads. We contact influencers. We try to get radio and TV coverage. The goal is to make as many people as possible aware that JamiiSanaa exists."

> "This is also when we start actively marketing to buyers - running Facebook ads, Google ads, reaching out to the diaspora, contacting corporate buyers. Budget: 350,000."

**PHASE 5: Growth** (show momentum):
> "Months 10, 11, and 12 - now we're scaling. We want to go from 30-50 artists to 100+ artists by the end of Year 1."

> "We open the platform to non-Baraza artists, but with a verification process so we maintain quality. We expand to Baraza's other hubs - Nairobi, Mombasa, Nakuru."

> "We launch more advanced features - full NFT minting, better auction tools, the commission system. We might even start building the mobile app."

> "We host our first major auction event - curate some really special pieces, invite VIP buyers, create excitement."

> "By the end of this phase, we should have 100+ active artists, 500+ artworks listed, and we should be seeing a clear path to breaking even. Budget: 300,000."

**The Total** (bring it together):
> "Add it all up, that's 3.2 million shillings for Year 1. That sounds like a lot, but remember:"
> - "1.5 million is just paying developers - that's the cost of skilled labor"
> - "400,000 is infrastructure - servers don't run for free"
> - "800,000 is ongoing operations - keeping the lights on after launch"
> - "The rest is marketing and legal - necessary investments"

**The Funding** (reiterate the ask):
> "Where does that 3.2 million come from? Our request is 2 million from Baraza's 2026 budget. Fred and I contribute 500,000 in our time and expertise. We're applying for grants to bring in another 500,000. And we expect some early revenue - maybe 200,000 - from sales in the later months."

**The Return** (show the payoff):
> "Now, Year 1 is investment. We're not profitable yet. But look at Year 2 and 3:"

> "Year 2 - 250 artists, 6,000 transactions, 11.25 million in revenue, and 6.75 million in PROFIT. Baraza's 60% share: 4 million shillings."

> "Year 3 - 500 artists, 15,000 transactions, 33.75 million in revenue, 26.75 million in PROFIT. Baraza's 60% share: 16 million shillings."

> "So you invest 2 million once. You get back 4 million in Year 2. Then 16 million per year after that. That's an incredible return."

**Acknowledge the Leap** (show empathy):
> "I know this roadmap asks Baraza to take a leap of faith. You're committing 2 million to something that doesn't exist yet. That's not easy."

> "But look at what you get: a detailed plan, a proven team, clear milestones, measurable outcomes, and the potential to generate millions while helping hundreds of artists. I genuinely believe this is one of the best investments Baraza could make."

**Transition** (introduce the team):
> "So let me tell you about the team that's going to make this happen..."

## PITCH SCRIPT FOR SLIDE 8 (3 minutes)

**Introduce the Team** (build confidence):
> "So let me introduce you to the team that's going to build and run this platform. Because at the end of the day, this all comes down to people. Do we have the right people with the right skills and commitment?"

**The Co-Founders** (establish credibility):
> "First, the co-founders - that's Fred and me, Allan. I'm the lead developer. My background is in software engineering with [X] years of experience building web platforms. I'll be leading the overall development, making the big technical decisions, and managing the business side."

> "Fred is our blockchain specialist. He's the one who really knows cryptocurrency, NFTs, smart contracts - all that Web3 stuff. When I said we're building NFT features on Polygon with lazy minting, Fred is the guy who knows exactly how to do that. He's critical for making the blockchain side work."

> "Both of us are based right here in Kisumu. This isn't some foreign team building remotely. We're local. We're part of this community. We're invested in Kenya's success."

**The Development Team** (show capacity):
> "We have a development team of 6 skilled developers ready to work on this. Let me break down who they are:"

> "Two frontend developers - they build what you see and interact with. The beautiful interfaces, the smooth user experience, making sure everything works perfectly on phones since most Kenyans use mobile."

> "Two backend developers - they build the invisible stuff. The database that stores all the information. The API that connects everything. The M-Pesa integration. All the business logic that makes the platform actually work."

> "One blockchain developer - working with Fred to build the NFT smart contracts, integrate wallets, handle all the cryptocurrency complexity."

> "And one QA engineer - quality assurance. Their job is to break things on purpose, find every bug, test every feature, make sure nothing goes wrong when real users are on the platform."

> "Six developers might not sound like a lot, but it's the right size for an MVP. Big enough to move fast, small enough to stay coordinated."

**The Baraza Team** (emphasize partnership):
> "But this isn't just our team. This is a partnership. So we're counting on the Baraza team to play critical roles too."

**Speak to Them Directly** (make it personal):
> "Godfrey, we're going to need you for operations and oversight. Artist verification - when someone uploads art, making sure it meets quality standards. Coordinating logistics if art is stored here at Baraza. Providing operational oversight to make sure everything runs smoothly. You know the Baraza operations better than anyone."

> "Akinyi, your events expertise is gold. We need you to help us plan and execute the launch event - you've done dozens of Baraza events, you know what works. Ongoing art auctions and showcases. Marketing and community engagement. Helping artists feel comfortable and excited about this new platform. Your skills are perfect for this."

> "And beyond you two, we'll need support from other Baraza community managers and staff. People who can help with artist onboarding, training, relationship management. JamiiSanaa will work best when it's a true collaboration between tech expertise and community connection."

**Governance** (show structure):
> "Now, how do we make decisions together? We're proposing a joint board structure. Two representatives from Baraza - maybe the director and someone from operations or finance. Two from the tech team - Fred and me. That's four people."

> "For major decisions - big expenses, strategic changes, new partnerships - we need 75% approval. That's 3 out of 4 votes. This means neither side can make huge decisions alone. It forces collaboration and ensures both perspectives are heard."

> "We'll meet quarterly to review performance, look at the numbers, discuss what's working and what needs to change. And annually, we do big-picture strategy planning."

**Operational Clarity** (avoid conflicts):
> "Day-to-day, though, there's clear separation. The tech team handles platform operations - fixing bugs, adding features, managing servers, customer support for technical issues. Baraza team handles artist and community management - verification, onboarding, events, relationship building."

> "Clear roles mean less conflict and faster decisions."

**External Support** (show we're not alone):
> "We'll also bring in external advisors as needed. Legal counsel - that NGO law specialist I mentioned. Business advisors to help with strategy. Maybe a marketing consultant if we need expertise in digital advertising."

> "We're not trying to do everything ourselves. We'll get help where we need it."

**Why This Team Will Succeed** (summarize confidence):
> "So why will this team succeed?"

> "One - we have the technical skills. Fred and I and our developers can absolutely build this platform. That's not a question."

> "Two - we have local knowledge. We understand Kenya. We understand M-Pesa. We understand how Kenyans buy and sell. We're not outsiders trying to impose some foreign solution."

> "Three - we have Baraza's community connections and trust. That's something we could never build on our own."

> "Four - we're committed. This isn't a side project for us. This is what we want to build our careers around."

> "And five - we have a clear, detailed plan. We're not winging it. We've thought through every phase, every cost, every challenge."

**Transition** (close the presentation):
> "So that's the team. Now let me wrap up with our ask and next steps..."

> "Baraza has done incredible work empowering creatives in Kenya through training, events, and community building. JamiiSanaa is the next evolution of that mission - using technology to create sustainable, scalable, measurable impact for hundreds of artists."

> "We can't do this without Baraza. And we genuinely believe Baraza shouldn't pass up this opportunity."

> "Let's build something transformative for Kenya's creative economy - together."

---

## PITCH SCRIPT FOR SLIDE 9 (5 minutes)

**Express Gratitude** (start warm):
> "Godfrey, Akinyi - thank you so much for your time today. I know you're both incredibly busy, and we really appreciate you hearing us out."

**Recap Quickly** (remind them of the journey):
> "So let me quickly recap what we've covered in the last 20 minutes:"

> "We talked about the problem - that talented artists at Baraza and across Kenya can't sell their work consistently because there's no good marketplace."

> "We introduced the solution - JamiiSanaa, a digital platform that lets artists sell 24/7, reach global buyers, and get paid quickly through M-Pesa."

> "We showed you the top features - marketplace, M-Pesa integration, Baraza verified badge, global reach, commission system - all solving real problems."

> "We explained what we need - 2 million shillings from Baraza's 2026 budget, access to the artist community, physical space, and brand credibility."

> "We addressed challenges - legal structure, costs, sustainability, NGO compliance - and showed we have solutions."

> "We walked through the 12-month roadmap - planning, development, testing, launch, growth."

> "And we introduced the team - Fred and me as co-founders, 6 skilled developers, and the critical role Baraza plays."

**The Core Proposition** (summarize in 30 seconds):
> "The bottom line is this: We want to build Kenya's first artist-first art marketplace in partnership with Baraza. 60/40 ownership split. Baraza invests 2 million shillings, gets 60% ownership. By Year 3, that 2 million investment returns 16 million per year while helping hundreds of artists earn sustainable income."

**What We Need From You** (be direct):
> "So here's what we're asking from you today:"

**Ask 1: Be Champions** (this is crucial):
> "First and most important - we need you to be our champions inside Baraza. You know the organization. You know how decisions get made. You know who the key people are."

> "We need you to take this to Baraza leadership - whether that's the director, the board, the budget committee, whoever makes these decisions - and say: 'I've seen this proposal. I think it's solid. I think it aligns with our mission. I think we should seriously consider this.'"

> "You don't need to say 'approve this immediately.' But we need you to advocate for at least putting it on the agenda, getting it into the 2026 budget discussion."

**Ask 2: Honest Feedback** (invite criticism):
> "Second - and this is equally important - we need your honest feedback. What concerns do you have? What parts didn't make sense? What would you change? What are we missing?"

> "We'd much rather hear tough questions now and improve the proposal than have you nod politely today and not actually champion it internally. Be real with us."

**Ask 3: Facilitate Next Steps** (logistics):
> "Third - help us navigate next steps. Who should we present to next? When can we get on their calendar? What's the process for getting into the 2026 budget? How do decisions like this typically get made at Baraza?"

> "We're outsiders to Baraza's internal processes. You're insiders. We need that knowledge."

**The Timeline** (make it concrete):
> "If Baraza approves this, here's what the timeline looks like:"

> "Ideally, in the next week or two, you share this with leadership and get their initial reaction. Then we present to whoever needs to see it - maybe a board meeting, maybe a leadership meeting."

> "By Month 2, if they approve, we're working with lawyers to finalize the structure and agreements. Budget gets committed."

> "Month 3, we start development. Team starts building."

> "Month 9, we're launching publicly at a big event right here at Baraza Kisumu."

> "That's the path forward if this works."

**If It Doesn't Work** (show flexibility):
> "Now, if Baraza decides this isn't the right fit - whether it's budget constraints, different priorities, concerns we can't resolve - we'll understand. We'll be disappointed, but we'll understand."

> "We'll look for other partners or funding sources. We'll apply to accelerators, grants, maybe even try to raise investment money. We might build a smaller version on our own."

> "But I want to be very clear: Baraza is our first choice. The mission alignment, the community, the trust, the physical presence - everything fits. We genuinely believe this partnership would be more successful than any other option."

**Open the Floor** (invite questions):
> "So now - your turn. What questions do you have? What concerns? What feedback?"

*Pause. Let them ask questions. Some common ones and how to answer:*

---

### **HANDLING COMMON QUESTIONS** (Preparation)

**Q: "How confident are you that artists will actually use this?"**
> "Great question. Here's why I'm confident: We're not trying to get random artists. We're starting with Baraza's existing members who already trust you. We only need 20-30 to start. Once they make their first sales and share those success stories - 'I sold a painting for 15,000 shillings in one week!' - others will follow. Word of mouth is powerful. Plus we're making it really simple - if they can use WhatsApp, they can use JamiiSanaa."

**Q: "What if not enough buyers come to the platform?"**
> "Also a great question. That's why we have a aggressive marketing plan. We're targeting specific buyer groups: Kenyan diaspora (3 million people who want art from home), corporate buyers (offices need art for walls), interior designers (who source for clients), tourists (who visited Kenya and want memories). We'll run targeted ads, partner with organizations, use Baraza's existing reach. Plus, we only need modest sales at first. If each of 100 artists sells 2 pieces per month, that's 200 sales. Totally achievable."

**Q: "Is 2 million too much to ask from our budget?"**
> "I understand 2 million is significant. But consider: What other investment offers 8× return in 3 years? Year 2, Baraza gets 4 million back. Year 3, 16 million. Every year after that. Plus the intangible benefits - artist impact, media attention, innovation leadership. Show me another use of 2 million that delivers that kind of financial and social return. Also, remember Baraza isn't funding it alone. Total project value is 3.2 million with grants and our contributions."

**Q: "How involved will Baraza need to be day-to-day?"**
> "Minimal. Main ongoing tasks: Artist verification - someone reviews uploaded art to approve it, maybe 30 minutes per day. Promoting the platform to artists. And coordinating events if you want. All the technical stuff - maintenance, customer support, bug fixes, payments - Fred and I handle. You're not hiring us as staff. We're partners who manage operations."

**Q: "What if this fails?"**
> "Honestly? Then Baraza loses 2 million and gains learning. It's a risk. But we've done everything possible to reduce that risk: Conservative projections. Phased approach. Proven technology. Clear roadmap. Committed team. Starting small and scaling. I can't guarantee success - no one can with any business. But I can guarantee we'll work our hardest and be transparent every step of the way."

**Q: "Why should we trust you?"**
> "Fair question. You don't know us well. Here's what I'd say: Look at the work we've put in already. This isn't a casual pitch. We've created comprehensive documentation - 100+ pages of research, financial models, technical specs, user flows. We've identified specific grants to apply for. We've thought through challenges and solutions. This is months of work before asking for a shilling. That shows commitment. Plus, we're proposing clear governance - joint board, quarterly reporting, transparency. You'll have oversight."

---

**After Q&A** (close strong):

**Acknowledge Their Position** (show empathy):
> "I know this is a big decision. And I know it's not your decision alone to make. You have to take this to others, explain it, defend it if needed. That's a lot to ask."

**Offer Support** (make it easier):
> "So here's what we'll do: We'll send you all the materials - this presentation, the full proposal documents, the financial projections, everything. Use whatever helps. We're also happy to present to whoever you think needs to see it. Want us at a board meeting? We'll come. Want a smaller meeting with the director first? We'll do that. Whatever makes this easier for you."

**Express Belief** (from the heart):
> "Look, at the end of the day, this comes down to belief. Do you believe this can work? Do you believe it's worth the investment? Do you believe Fred and I are the right people to build it?"

> "We obviously believe all those things. We wouldn't be here otherwise. But you need to believe them too if you're going to champion this internally."

> "So take some time. Think about it. Talk to each other. Talk to others at Baraza. And then let us know - are you in? Do you want to build JamiiSanaa together?"

**Final Gratitude** (leave well):
> "Whatever you decide, thank you. Thank you for listening. Thank you for considering it. Thank you for the work you do at Baraza empowering artists every day. That's what inspired us to create this proposal in the first place."

**The Hopeful Close** (end on vision):
> "Imagine 9 months from now. We're standing right here at Baraza for the JamiiSanaa launch party. Artists are showing their work on big screens. Buyers are browsing on their phones and making purchases. Media is here covering it. Artists are getting sale notifications in real-time and celebrating."

> "Jane, the painter we talked about, comes up to you and says: 'Thank you. Because of JamiiSanaa, I sold 10 paintings this year. I earned 150,000 shillings. I can finally pay my rent and buy more supplies. You changed my life.'"

> "That's what we're building toward. And you two - Godfrey, Akinyi - you can be the ones who made it happen."

**Final Line** (leave them thinking):
> "So... what do you think? Questions? Concerns? Feedback? What are you thinking?"

*Stop talking. Let them respond. Listen carefully. Take notes. Thank them again. And leave them with hope and next steps.*
