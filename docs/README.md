Great UI
Sound use of the technology
Over-communicating in your checkpoints, github.
A great video.

Build a functional prototype, clearly demonstrate your solution, meet challenge requirements, and create a polished pitch/demo.

The hackathon is about below 
Main Challenge
The theme of the Buildathon is exploring the future of IP in an increasingly AI-driven world. 
We’re inviting developers, designers, marketers, researchers, and creative technologists to prototype new models for owning, exchanging, and enforcing IP onchain. 

From Chat-GPT like interfaces with built-in IP registration to physical engineering projects to new finance applications for IP, Surreal World Assets is a proving ground for infrastructure that makes intellectual property composable, monetizable, and machine-readable

Top Prize($5,000)
$3,000 (in IP) Cash Prize + $2,000 Continuation Prize per track
Data isn’t just quantity, it’s quality, structure, and licensing.
The future of AI is powered by crowdsourcing PoV videos, drone footage, motion captures from XR, and other data samples — all rights-cleared and registered as IP on Story.
Examples:

    A Poseidon-like app that instead of facilitating the registration of audio-data, facilitates the registration of other types of data (stereo video, motion, robotics data, medical data, etc)
