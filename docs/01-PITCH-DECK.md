# PITCH DECK: Kenya's Next-Generation Art Marketplace
**Proposal for Baraza Media Lab - 2026 Funding Initiative**

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### The Vision
We are building Kenya's premier digital art marketplace that combines traditional art sales with blockchain/NFT technology to empower local artists while creating sustainable revenue streams for Baraza Media Lab, artists, and the tech team.

### The Problem
- Baraza Media Lab Kisumu has a large room storing locally-made art, paintings, and photographs from students, residents, and talented individuals
- Art is not being sold effectively - lack of proper marketing and distribution channels
- Artists struggle to monetize their skills - art business in Kenya is undervalued despite talent
- No centralized platform connecting Kenyan artists with local and global buyers
- Limited access to digital art markets (NFTs) for African creators

### The Solution
A comprehensive digital marketplace platform featuring:
- Traditional e-commerce for physical art sales
- NFT minting and trading capabilities for digital art ownership
- Bidding/auction system for high-value pieces
- Artist commissioning and private hiring system
- Integrated payment solutions (M-Pesa, bank transfers, crypto)
- Marketing and community-building tools for Baraza Media

### Market Opportunity
- Kenya's NFT market projected to reach 9.91K users by 2025
- 4M-7M Kenyans actively trading cryptocurrencies
- 6% of Kenya's millionaires now own NFTs
- Growing global interest in African art and creators
- Baraza Media Lab reaching 5,000+ young people through mentorship programs

**Structure**: Tech team owns and operates platform; Baraza pays for service

**Baraza Pays**:
- Monthly platform fee (KES 50,000-100,000) OR

**Pros for Baraza**:
- No upfront capital investment

### Option 2: Equity Partnership (50/50 or 60/40)

**Revenue Split Options**:

- Board representation: 2 from Baraza, 2 from Tech, 1 independent
- Quarterly profit distribution after operating expenses

### Option 3: Acquisition/Full Integration
**Structure**: Baraza hires tech team as employees or department

**Tech Team Receives**:

## 9. RECOMMENDED PARTNERSHIP APPROACH

**Governance**:
- Joint board: 2 Baraza reps, 2 Tech reps

- Quarterly financial reviews and profit distributions

**Protection Mechanisms**:
- Vesting schedule: Tech team equity vests over 3 years (protection against abandonment)
- Non-compete clause: 2 years post-exit
- IP ownership: Platform IP owned by joint venture entity
- Exit clauses: Right of first refusal if either party wants to sell

**Legal Structure**:
