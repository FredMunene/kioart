# kyo-art — Demo Pitch Deck Notes
*(Based on the Web3 Developer Clubs pitch deck structure)*

## The Setup
- **1. Problem**  
  Kenyan/African artists face duplication/theft (AI scraping, reposting), fragmented provenance, and slow/opaque payouts. Galleries hold unsold art; creators lack verifiable proof and sustainable income.

- **2. Solution**  
  kyo-art: a provenance-first art/IP marketplace. Artists upload once; we pin media, verify originality, register IP on-chain, and list with clear rights and payouts.

- **3. Demo (show, don’t tell)**  
  Flow: Connect wallet → Upload → Yakoa check → Story IP register → List (fixed/auction) with provenance chips → Buyer purchase/bid.

- **4. The “Secret Sauce” (Technology)**  
  - Embedded wallets (Coinbase CDP) for seamless onboarding/payouts.  
  - Authenticity check via Yakoa token API to flag duplicates/high-originality.  
  - Story Protocol registration for on-chain IP + explorer link.  
  - IPFS pinning (Pinata) + Supabase metadata for fast retrieval and analytics.  
  - Provenance surfaced simply (Verified / IP Registered / NFT Minted), no jargon.

- **5. Market**  
  Growing global demand for African art + rising AI-era rights concerns. Local market underserved; early focus on Kenyan creators and partners (e.g., Baraza Media Lab).

## The Execution
- **6. Traction**  
  Baraza media Lab, a creative workspace/ co-working space with 7 branches in 3 east african countries looking to partner. Receive an inflow of 12k guests and visitors a month. traffic for art and transaction.

- **7. Business Model**  
  Transaction fees on sales; optional storage/insurance fees via org partners; premium placement; future licensing/royalty flows (Story).

- **8. Under the Hood (Architecture)**  
  Next.js + CDP providers; Pinata/IPFS for media; Yakoa `/token` API for authenticity; Story SDK for IP registration; Supabase for data; provenance chips in UI; duplicate CID guardrails.

- **9. Team**  
  Kenya-based builders with Web3/IP experience; aligned with creative orgs (e.g., Baraza) for trust, storage, and distribution. Fred Gitonga - web3 and software engineer. Allan Robinson  - Project Manager, Operations  Anne Maina - Marketing and People .

- **10. Ask**  
  Support piloting with festival/partners; introductions to rights/collecting orgs; feedback on policy/comms; runway to scale verification + Story registrations and launch paid listings. !*** End Patch__(/*!
